/* The programs in this language are called scripts. 
They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads. 
When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. 

But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning 
a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, 
or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
